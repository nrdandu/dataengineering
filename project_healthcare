🏥 Project Title: "Improving Patient Outcomes through Data-Driven Insights"
🎯 Objective : To analyze patient data (admissions, diagnoses, treatments, outcomes) and uncover trends in readmissions, treatment efficacy, and provider performance. The goal is to identify actionable insights to reduce readmissions and improve care quality.

📘 Phase 1: Project Initiation & Planning
  ✅ Deliverables:
  Project Charter
  Stakeholder Alignment
  Requirements Gathering Document

  🔍 Key Activities:
  Identify primary stakeholders (Clinical Ops, IT, Compliance).
  Define business problem: “30-day readmission rate is above national average.”
  Set goals: reduce readmission by 10%, understand top readmission causes.

📝 Phase 2: Project Scope & Requirements
  ✅ Deliverables:
  Defined KPIs (Readmission Rate, Avg. LOS, Treatment Outcome Score)

  Data Requirements Matrix
  Compliance checklist (HIPAA data handling)
  🔍 Key Activities:
  List metrics: % readmitted within 30 days, avg. cost per treatment, diagnosis vs. outcome.
  Define granularity (patient-level, hospital-level).
  Document PHI handling protocol and access restrictions.

🗃️ Phase 3: Data Source Identification
  ✅ Deliverables:
  Source-to-Target Mapping (STM)

  Data Access Plan
  🔍 Key Activities:
  Pull datasets from:
  EHR (Electronic Health Records) → demographics, diagnoses, vitals.
  Claims → services used, costs, dates.
  Provider Directory → hospital/doctor metadata.
  Understand formats (CSV, Parquet, database tables).

Set up PySpark connectors to Snowflake/AWS/S3.

🏗️ Phase 4: Data Extraction & ETL Pipeline (Python + PySpark)
  ✅ Deliverables: ETL Workflow (documented in code and markdown)

  Cleaned and joined dataset ready for analysis

  🔍 Key Activities:
  Use PySpark to:
  Read and validate input files.
  Clean data (null handling, deduplication, outlier filtering).
  Join tables (EHR + Claims + Providers).
  Create derived features (e.g., days to readmission, risk score).
  Save final dataset as partitioned Parquet for downstream use.

📊 Phase 5: Data Analysis (SQL + Python)
  ✅ Deliverables: Analysis notebooks/SQL scripts
  Insight summary deck
  🔍 Key Activities:
  Use SQL or PySpark to:
  Group by patient & condition to get readmission trends.
  Identify top 5 diagnoses associated with high readmission.
  Correlate LOS (length of stay) with outcomes.
  Run regression analysis or classification (optional stretch):
  Logistic Regression on readmission probability.

📈 Phase 6: Dashboard Development (Tableau / Power BI)
  ✅ Deliverables:Readmission Insight Dashboard
  Stakeholder review walkthrough
  🔍 Key Activities:
  Build Tableau or Power BI dashboards:
  Filters: Hospital, Diagnosis, Age Group.
  Charts: Time trend of readmissions, heatmaps of provider performance.
  Tooltips and drilldowns for interactive exploration.
  Share via Tableau Server or Power BI Workspace.

🧪 Phase 7: Validation, Feedback & Deployment
  ✅ Deliverables: QA report
  Final stakeholder presentation
  UAT Sign-off
  🔍 Key Activities:
  Validate ETL accuracy (row counts, nulls, aggregations).
  Collect clinical stakeholder feedback.
  Finalize and publish dashboards.
  Document all pipelines and analyses.

🚧 Common Challenges You’ll Simulate Solving
PHI anonymization for development environments.
Handling missing outcome data.
Joining tables with inconsistent patient identifiers.
Keeping Spark jobs performant on large claims datasets.
